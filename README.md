# PURPOSE

This script should extrapolate if SOL is on-track to reach a high value by the end of the bull run or if it is below-target and we should invest in something else

# INSTALLATION

run 

python3 -m http.server

go to localhost:8000 in the browser


adjust the parameters in the variables in script.js

you need SOLBUSD.csv separately because it is 133 MB
